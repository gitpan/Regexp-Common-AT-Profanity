    the works of this interface. Do not use this module directly, but load

PATTERNS
    $RE{at}{profanity}
        Provides a regex to match profanity in Austrian German. Note that
        correct anatomical terms are deliberately *not* included in the
        list, nor are those words which also have genuinely non-offensive
        meanings.

        Under "-keep" (see Regexp::Common):

        $1  captures the entire word
